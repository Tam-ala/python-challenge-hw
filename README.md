![Vote-Counting](Images/Vote_counting.png)

* In this challenge, I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. 

* I was given a set of poll data called [election_data.csv](PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv). The dataset is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`. My task was to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.

  * In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
